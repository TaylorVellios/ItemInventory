Here is a simple VBA script to run on an empty Excel Worksheet.<br/>
Run the Macro named "InventorySheet" to get started.<br/>
Every line entered in the yellow sections is automatically added below. Itemized numbers in Column 1 are automatically generated.<br/>
When "Add Item" is pressed, the active cell returns to B3 so you can enter things quickly with minimal mouse movements.
